#this is the additional module to be used for the Aquila speaker droop test, 
#this will use the joulescope to record amp current into the device, 

#joulescope config goes as follow, 
#BOTH IN on the JS goes to the + side of the DUT, 
#BOTH OUT on the JS goes to the - side of the DUT, 

#NOTES: ALL CURRENT READINGS are to be positive, if negative readings are detected multiply by 1,
